Course / Year : BS Computer Science - 3rd Year

What I learned: Git Vs GitHub

Git -> a tool you install on your computer. It keeps track of changes you make to your files (like saving versions of your code).

GitHub -> a website where you can store those Git projects online, so you can back them up, share them, and work with others.
